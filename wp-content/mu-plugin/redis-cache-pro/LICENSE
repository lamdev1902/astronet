7.2  Without limiting the generality of Section 7.1, you acknowledge and agree that:

  * when using Object Cache Pro, you will consider the data stored in your Redis server to be ephemeral; and

  * if there is no or weak connection between Object Cache Pro and your Redis server, the data stored with Object Cache Pro may become stale. In rare situations, the lack of or weak connection may cause WordPress to use stale cache data and/or write the stale cache data to your WordPress’ database, thereby overwriting the more recent data. It is your responsibility to ensure that Object Cache Pro stays connected to your Redis server.

8. Consent to the Use of Data. You agree that Rhubarb and its affiliates may collect and use technical data and related information that is gathered to facilitate the provision of the Software, software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Software. For example, via an API endpoint, the Software’s API may communicate with an end user’s server(s), wherein Rhubarb’s server(s) may request for technical data and/or related information and may receive a response from the Software’s API. Rhubarb may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve Rhubarb’s products or to provide services or technologies to you.  With respect to personally identifiable information, please review Rhubarb’s Privacy Policy [@Till: please insert hyperlink].

9. Audit. We or a certified auditor acting on our behalf, may, upon its reasonable request and at its expense, audit you with respect to the use of the Software. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to your place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. We shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that you are using the Software in a way that is in material violation of this EULA, then you shall pay our reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, you agree to pay us any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. In addition, we reserve the right, at our sole option, to terminate the licenses for the Software.

10. Third Party Software. Examples included in Software may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively "Third Party Software") to implement various functions. Third Party Software does not form any part of the Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Software may be included along with the Software delivery as a convenience for demonstration purposes. Such source code and libraries may be included in the "…/examples" source tree delivered with the Software and do not form any part the Software. You shall not use, distribute, reproduce, or otherwise commercially exploit any Third Party Software unless you have obtained applicable license(s) from the Third Party Software’s owner(s).
