For all experts in healthy & low-calorie nutrition or sports: meet the most effective feature for your WordPress website!

WordPress Calorie Calculator by <a href="https://belovdigital.agency/">Belov</a> a plugin that works wonders in user attraction.

This plugin is weight management made simple. Whether you are launching a WordPress website to help others achieve their desired body mass or working on your own shape and fitness, the WP Calorie Calculator plugin is what you’re looking for.

Having a calorie calculator on your website is an absolute must if your business is in the nutrition and fitness sector. Your clients will most definitely enjoy the opportunity to monitor and manage their daily calorie norms and body mass with the help of your website. Make your service catchy!


<h3><strong>A GREAT TIME-SAVER</strong></h3>
So many factors affect our energy consumption needs that estimating the necessary calorie intake in mind would be too complicated. You end up wasting half of your day doing lots of math with your calories, weight, and height and comparing your target body mass to your current weight.

No one wants to spend their life on endless calculations! Let your visitors delegate that tedious work to our WordPress Calorie Calculator plugin. Install it and make your website attract even more sports and weight management strivers.


<h3><strong>SCIENCE BEHIND THE CALORIES</strong></h3>
BMR, or basal metabolic rate, is one of the most widely used parameters for defining the preferred calorie ratio. For our calculator plugin, we use the <strong>Mifflin—St. Jeor formula.</strong> It identifies BMR by analyzing the essential features of your organism: <strong>body mass, height, age, and biological sex.</strong> The plugin calculates daily calorie consumption rate using those numbers with the multipliers needed to account for the <strong>goals</strong> and <strong>conditions.</strong> The formula also takes sports and other <strong>types of activity</strong> into account: this way, the users can be sure that the calorie norm offered by WP Calorie Calculator corresponds with their individual physical characteristics such as weight, height, and others.


<h3><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></h3>
Our Calorie Calculator for WordPress gives you the shortcode for your website’s page, post, or sidebar. Put it anywhere it suits the most to catch the attention of your visitors!

<h4><strong>Weight, heights, goals: the calculator accounts for everything</strong></h4>
Once you have installed the plugin, you get a neatly designed Calculator settings section in your WordPress admin area. There are a few tabs where you can configure input fields for age, body mass, and height, gender selector, and measure units toggle. Other parameters are configurable in the <a href="https://wpcaloriecalculator.com/">Pro edition of WP Calorie Caluclator</a> (UPD: V4 is out!). Among those, there are lifestyle for which users tick the one that fits them best and body mass goals with the dropdown menu offering weight maintenance, loss, or gain (and the pace of the process).

<h4><strong>Units & auto conversion</strong></h4>
WP Calorie Calculator works with metric and imperial units to ensure convenience for everyone. And should users forget to switch units, the plugin will convert everything automatically with a click of the toggle. No need to rack your brain over retyping and converting.
 
<h4><strong>Increasing screentime</strong></h4>
This built-in calculator will, without a doubt, be a most-liked feature on your website—people will hardly manage to resist the urge to check out their daily calorie norm set up in accordance with their body mass goals.
 
<h4><strong>Handy & user-friendly</strong></h4>
It runs as you go: if you select an instant view, WordPress Calorie Calculator demonstrates the results straight after everything is typed. No need to click on any additional buttons: our calculator plugin is as user-friendly as possible. Alternatively, you can ask users to provide their emails to which the plugin will send the results.

<h3><strong>MAKE IT UNIQUE</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Styling</strong></h4>
The plugin allows to change the interface colors to make them fit your website design. In the free version, only 2 types of colors—primary and secondary—are changeable. The <a href="https://wpcaloriecalculator.com/">Pro version</a> provides much more flexibility and lets you define the color of almost every detail on the screen, from the title to the on-hover state color.

<h4><strong>Instant or email results</strong></h4>
You can also choose how results will be delivered to your visitor—directly in the form or via email. The first option implies that the amount of calories is displayed once the user submits all the necessary input. The latter can help a great deal in email marketing. To make the work on that easier, we added Mailchimp and Zapier integration in the <a href="https://wpcaloriecalculator.com/">Calculator Pro</a>.


<h3><strong>PRO EDITION</strong></h3>
Advanced features, email marketing service integrations, and new & improved admin dashboard design: make the most of WP Calorie Calculator!
