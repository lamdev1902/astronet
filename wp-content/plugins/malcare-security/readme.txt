=How many times does MalCare auto-scan a website?=
MalCare automatic security scans a website once every 24 hours.

=How does MalCare detect complex malware?=
MalCare Security Service scans all your website WordPress files beyond just signatures and evaluates them automatically using powerful technology with the collective knowledge of 240,000+ sites. It uses 100 + intelligent signals automatically for deep security scanning and combing through all the files. That is how it detects even the most complex and well-hidden malware on your site.

=Does MalCare affect my site performance?=
No, not at all. MalCare Security Service performs all the heavy lifting of scanning your entire site WordPress files on its own. It does not use your site resources. MalCare Security Service runs its security operations on MalCare servers, thereby ensuring zero loads from its side on your website.

=How does the unlimited cleanup policy work?=
A situation may occur where your site is being repeatedly infected. In such events, there is no limit to the number of times you can **[clean up a hacked website](http://bit.ly/2RHzkD2)**.

But if the situation persists, then cleaning up the site, again and again, will not solve the problem. In such cases, you can **[contact us](https://www.malcare.com/contact/)**, and we will help improve your security posture. We’d ask you to take proactive measures based on the recommendation of the Support team. We reserve the right to refuse service until appropriate actions are taken from your end. In cases like this, we also reserve the right to deny refund or cancellation of the MalCare Security account.

=What do I need to clean my website?=
In order to begin the cleanup process, we need access to your server and its associated files. (Don’t worry, this will not compromise your site’s security).

We get this access in the form of FTP, SFTP, or SSH access to your server. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, sFTP for Secure File Transfer Protocol, and SSH for Secure Shell. These are connection protocol mechanisms that allow us to log into servers to edit/add/remove files. These connection protocols allow us to log into your websites, specifically the server, and perform the remediation process. If you for some reason are unfamiliar with these protocols, don’t worry, our team of security analysts is prepared to assist you in the process. To do so, you’ll need to be willing to share access information to your hosting account.

We covered how to clean a website **[here](http://bit.ly/2RHzkD2)**. Here’s a guide on **[how to find FTP credentials](http://bit.ly/2RFPeOl)** and another guide on **[how to locate a folder where WordPress is installed](http://bit.ly/2RFPf4R)**.

=How long does it take to clean a site?=
It really depends on the size of the website. In average, **[cleaning up with MalCare Security](http://bit.ly/2RHzkD2)** usually takes 5-10 mins.

=How does the Login Page Protection work?=
**[MalCare’s Login Protection](http://bit.ly/2RKbDKn)** feature prevents bots from entering your website stealing your data, spamming, and other malicious activities that threaten the security of your site.

=How does the Site Hardening work?=
WordPress has recommended a few extra security measures which will harden the security of your website. We have incorporated those recommendations in our Site Hardening feature. Kindly have a look at our guide on **[how to implement Site Hardening](http://bit.ly/2RGnSYt)**.

=How does the Firewall work?=
MalCare Security Service was created after analyzing over 240,000 sites from scratch. The Firewall constantly monitors traffic from all places and automatically blocks IPs that seem malicious in nature. As such, it is **[automatically enabled](http://bit.ly/2RKbZAH)** and needs minimal overseeing.

**[MalCare Firewall Security](http://bit.ly/2RKIuyu)** ensures that attacks on your site by even bots are mitigated, without affecting your WordPress site. It monitors bots across a global level without ever overloading your server.

=Can I update WordPress core, plugins, and themes directly?=
Yes. Updating WordPress add-ons tightens the security of your website. Take a look at this **[Manage Site help doc](http://bit.ly/2RKhMGr)** to learn how to update WordPress add-ons.

=Can I manage my site users and their password directly?=
Yes. With MalCare managing WordPress, users have become easier. Take the help of this **[Manage Site help doc](http://bit.ly/2RKhMGr)**. Remember to delete the passive user account and encourage users to use a strong password for better security.

=Can I add Clients and Team Members to my account?=
Yes, you can.
Our client feature is for your reference alone. You can assign a client to their site. If you want to give a user, dashboard access, please add them as your team members under the team section. Please see **[How do I add clients and team members](http://bit.ly/2RKcKtx)**? For the sake of security, give dashboard access to only people you can trust.

=Will MalCare Security work if my site is down?=
We understand the pains of a website going down. If a site goes down after you have **[added the website](http://bit.ly/2ROE7CU)** and **[installed the security plugin](http://bit.ly/2RI7eHW)** from the dashboard, **[MalCare will clean up your site](http://bit.ly/2RHzkD2)**.
But if you add a website that was down beforehand, i.e. before adding the security plugin, then MalCare Security Service won’t work.


=What information does MalCare Security Service store?=
We only store data related to your site structure such as plugins/themes with their respective versions. This helps us identify vulnerabilities that may be present on the site. We track the IPs of visitors to your site, to identify malicious actors who might attack your site.

=What makes MalCare Security Service better than other WordPress security plugins?=
MalCare Security Service was developed after analyzing 240,000+ websites.
1. It uses 100+ internal signals to Scan and identify the most complex malware.
2. It pinpoints the malware’s exact location on your site. It does remote security scanning, to ensure there are Zero loads on your server.
3. MalCare comes with an industry-first One-Click Malware removal service that eliminates any malware in a jiffy.
4. We alert you only when there is a legitimate malicious discovery rather than 'possible hacks'.

We feel these features set us apart from most other WordPress security plugins. For further information take a look at how MalCare Security Service stands when compared with **[Top Security Plugins](http://bit.ly/2RKFdPG)**.

=I already have a backup solution. Something happens to my site, I can simply restore it. Why do I need a security plugin?=
Backups play a very important role in WordPress security, but it has some limitations. We have noticed that in many cases, it is weeks before a site owner realizes that his/her website has been hacked.

During this period multiple backups will be taken, and there will be a high chance that the files that contain the hack or the Malware are also backed up.

In such a case restoring from backup is not sufficient as it will not clean your website. Here is where a Malware solution like MalCare Security Service comes in. It does regular automated security scans of your website and notifies you if there is any sort of Malicious content on your website.

=Isn’t WordPress secure enough?=
WordPress core is safe, but the CMS does not work in isolation. Security plugins and themes are part of its ecosystem. Several studies on hacked sites show that plugins and themes are responsible for a majority of such compromises. MalCare Security Service is an easy and effective way of securing websites and keeping them safe from hack attempts. Look at this **[full feature list](http://bit.ly/2RJyRjV)**.

=Why will an SSL certificate not suffice?=
An SSL certificate is used only to encrypt a connection between the browser and server to safely transmit sensitive information. However, MalCare Security Service goes beyond and actually protects the database where this information is stored, scans your website files using 100+ intelligent signals automatically, and applications protect from data breaches and the spreading of viruses/malware. These functionalities are not provided by an SSL certificate.

=How is MalCare Security Service the best for agencies or developers?=
We’re the best because of three features:
1. We have developer-friendly plans that are easy on the wallet. If you’re a developer or an agency that hosts about 10 websites, the chances are that enterprise-level security packages would be too expensive for you. If you’ve got anything more than seven sites, take a look at our unlimited plans.
2. Our auto-clean feature makes sure that you can scan, and clean your sites by yourself, so you don’t waste precious time.
3. MalCare’s regular security scans alert you whenever it identifies hacks, so your sites are always secure.

=How does MalCare Security handle WordPress Multisite installs?=
We completely understand the concern and complexities surrounding WordPress Multisite installs. We treat each WordPress install as a license. It means that if you have a network of websites on a single WordPress installation, we treat that as a single license.

=Will MalCare Security Service slow down my website?=
MalCare runs on its own servers. We take great care to ensure that we do not add load to your site. We do all the hard work of security scanning, cleaning, and protecting, on our servers and this is our USP.

=Where are my FTP details processed?=
FTP details input into MalCare is processed on our servers. We need your FTP credentials to access your website’s files and folders. We feel that FTP transfer is the safest way to transfer data to and from a site. However, they are treated like payment details (i.e. they’re not stored on our servers). Once we’ve processed them, they’re deleted from our servers.

=Where can I find the MalCare Terms of Use and Privacy Policy?=
These are available on our website: [Terms of Service](https://www.malcare.com/tos/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.malcare.com/privacy/)
